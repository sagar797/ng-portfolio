        Hello :) My name is Sagar Gupta and I enjoy creating things that lives on the internet. Hello! My name is
        Brittany
        and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when
        I
        decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot
        about HTML & CSS!

        Fast-forward to today, and I"ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge
        corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive
        products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

        JavaScript (ES6+)
        TypeScript
        React
        Eleventy
        Node.js
        WordPress
